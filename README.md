## Hello, I am Piotriox

I‚Äôm a 16-year-old developer who started coding at the age of 13. Since then, I‚Äôve been building my skills through real projects and collaborations. I specialize in HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, JavaScript (basic), Lua, and Python. I also have experience with PHP, and I‚Äôm currently focusing on advancing my knowledge in JavaScript (intermediate/advanced), Next.js, MySQL, and MongoDB.

I have worked on and continue to develop multiple projects, including:

Lakeban ‚Äì a unique social media platform inspired by Discord and Reddit, where I work as the Lead & Sole Frontend Developer.

Kria Technologies ‚Äì a development studio I founded and currently own, which originally focused on game development and now operates in the field of web development.

Morsy Studios ‚Äì my first developer experience as a Roblox Game Developer, where I created games that reached over 2,000 players.

I‚Äôm passionate about learning, improving, and delivering high-quality work that combines functionality with clean design. My goal is to keep growing as a developer while creating impactful projects.
